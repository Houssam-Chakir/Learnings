//* Values can either Objects or Primitive

//? Objects like:
let me = {
    name: 'Houssam',
    age: 24,
}

//? Primitive like:
let firstName = 'Houssam';
let myAge = 24;

/**
 * * So there are seven primitive data types:
 * ? number, string, bullion, undefined, null, symbol and big int.
 * 
 * ? -Numbers: are one type for integers and floats unlike other languages.
 * ? -Undifined: is the value taken by a variable with no assigned value.
 * ? -Null: the same but used in different situations.
 * ? -Symbols: a unique value that cannot be changed.
 * ? -Bigint: a large number that cant be presented as numbers due to its size.

//* Dynamic typing: feature that allows JS to determine the type of a stored value automatically.
